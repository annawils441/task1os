Test Strategy
For a successful execution of the proposed solution, multiple types of data and testing will need to be implemented. This varies based on what features are being tested and what data is being used to test it.

When data inputs are tested within the application, various data types will be used to test the inputs and ensure that they accept the correct data without any errors, whilst giving justified textual errors to the user when receiving the incorrect input. Below I will explain each data type that I will be involving within the solution testing:
-	Normal data – This test data type is data that follows the validation rules related to the input. It is what the system is expecting within an input field and should be the only accepted input data. Normal data is used to ensure that the solution is working as intended. If there is a scenario where normal data is rejected by the system, this shows that there is an issue with the implementation of the input field and it will need to be fixed before continuing to test the software.
-	Erroneous data – This test data type is data that falls outside of what is acceptable and should be rejected by the system1. For example, a number within a name input field. It is used to ensure that the system does not accept invalid inputs. If there is a scenario where erroneous data is accepted by the system, this shows that there is an issue within the implementation of the input field which will need to be fixed before testing can continue.
-	Boundary data – This test data type is data that lies above or below what is accepted based on range values. For example, an age below 0 or an age below 18 on an age-restricted site. Boundary testing is carried out to ensure that the input validation fields are working as intended and that they only accept data within a set boundary, if applicable. 
-	Extreme data – This test data type is data at the upper or lower limits of expectations that should be accepted by the system2. However, it varies from boundary data because it shouldn’t be rejected as it still lies within the boundary, if the input field is working as intended. Extreme data may be large or very small pieces of content and it is used to observe how the system handles the input and ensure that it functions correctly and has the capacity to accept the input.

Additionally, there are several types of testing methods that I will be performing to verify the system functionality and security. Below I will explain each methodology that I will go on to use when testing the solution:
-	Unit testing – This is a form of testing that focuses on testing individual components of a software product3 to check that they meet set requirements. It can sometimes be referred to as module testing. Unit testing is performed to ensure that the logic of the software is correct and to help make sure that software is working as expected before release3. An example of a situation where unit testing would be used is to test that an input field accepts valid input and rejects invalid formats.
-	Integration testing – This is a form of testing in which various application components are joined and tested to evaluate4 how they perform together. It can sometimes be referred to as system testing. This testing type is conducted to ensure that design and operational requirements have been met within the software as a whole and that the modules can work together. An example of a scenario where integration testing would be used is to test that user registration can update the database connected to the program.
-	User Acceptance testing – This is a form of testing that checks how a system works against the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that have previously been set. The KPIs I will be testing on were set in my task 1 activity A(ii) project proposal. It will be tested by end users and clients at the final stage of testing the solution. An example where UAT will be used is to test a load KPI of if a solution can handle 50 users at one point in time.
-	Accessibility testing – This is a form of testing that ensures that a site can be accessed by all users and contain additional features to support those with additional needs. Accessibility is crucial to consider within a solution because it is required to follow Web Content Accessibility Guidelines and adhere to the Equality act. No users should be limited on their ability to navigate and use the site. An example of accessibility testing would be to test that a screen reader can access the site with detailed information about non-text functionality.
-	Performance testing – This is a form of testing that is completed to show how a system copes under various conditions like high concurrent users. KPIs are analysed to determine the performance of the solution. For example, the time it takes to load the site.
-	Load/Stress testing – This is a form of testing that analyses the system’s capacity to deal with many concurrent users or extreme stress conditions like Distributed Denial of Service attacks.
-	Security testing – This is a form of testing that focuses on identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities in a software application5. Security testing ensures that the product follows Data Protection guidelines. To conduct security testing, someone must carry out cyber security attacks such as SQL injections for checking the database security.
-	Browser Compatibility testing – This is a form of testing that ensures that a website operates consistently across different browsers. Various browsers have alternative rendering engines so they may present the software differently and it needs to be checked to keep consistency and compatibility across browsers.
